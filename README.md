# ðŸ“Œ Plex â†’ Taiga Sync 

This tool syncs anime playback from **Plex** server to **Taiga** using local files by running the file through a muted and small **MPV** window , matching your anime folder names automatically using AniList (primary) and TVDB (optional) metadata.  
It displays a live right-side panel with anime cover art, romaji + english titles, and a short synopsis â€” perfect for a Taiga-like experience.

I created this tool after noticing that, when streaming to my TV or phone, Taiga couldnâ€™t detect files being played from the Plex server running on the same device.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Automatic folder detection** from Plex libraries (no hardcoded paths)  
- **AniList metadata lookup** (titles, synonyms, cover art, synopsis) this was added after I noticed that while Plex uses romaji for the series naming, my folders would use english names pulled from TVDB by **Sonarr**
- **Optional TVDB fallback** for extra title matching  
- **Local folder matching** works even if Plex uses different naming conventions  
- **Metadata panel** shows:
  - Cover art (cached in `thumbs/`)
  - Romaji + English title
  - Short description
- **Image caching** for instant reloads
- **JSON cache** of matched folders + metadata (`matches.json`)
- **Opens MPV** in a small, muted corner window for sync purposes  
- **Ignores non-anime libraries** (only syncs the ones you specify)  
- **Clean exit** â€” MPV closes when the GUI closes

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Plex Media Server (local or remote access)
- MPV media player

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install plexapi customtkinter requests pillow pywin32
   ```

2. **Download the script** (`plex_taiga_sync_GUI.py`) and place it in a folder.

3. **Create a config file**:  
   Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in your settings:

   ```json
   {
       "PLEX_URL": "http://localhost:32400",
       "PLEX_TOKEN": "YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN",
       "USERNAME": "YourPlexUsername",
       "LIBRARY_NAMES": ["Anime", "Anime Seasonal"],
       "MPV_PATH": "C:\\Path\\To\\MPV\\mpv.exe",
       "POLL_INTERVAL": 3,
       "TVDB_API_KEY": ""
   }
   ```

4. **(Optional) Get a TVDB API Key:**  
   - Create an account at [thetvdb.com](https://thetvdb.com/).  
   - Go to your account dashboard and request an API key.  
   - Add it to `config.json` under `"TVDB_API_KEY"`.

## â–¶ Usage

### Run normally (console visible)
```bash
python plex_taiga_sync_GUI.py
```

### Run without console window (background mode)
1. Use `pythonw.exe` instead of `python.exe`:
   ```bash
   pythonw plex_taiga_sync_GUI.py
   ```
   This launches the GUI without a terminal window.

2. **Create a desktop shortcut**:
   - Right-click on your desktop â†’ **New** â†’ **Shortcut**.
   - For the location, enter:
     ```
     "C:\Path\To\Python\pythonw.exe" "C:\Path\To\plex_taiga_sync_GUI.py"
     ```
     *(Replace both paths with your actual Python and script locations.)*
   - Click **Next**, give it a name (e.g., `Plex Taiga Sync`), and click **Finish**.
   - Double-clicking this shortcut will run the script without a console window.

## ðŸ”Œ MPV IPC (Named Pipe)

This script launches MPV with an **IPC (inter-process communication) socket** using the `--input-ipc-server` flag.  
This allows the script to send commands to MPV (such as seeking, stopping, or checking playback status) while itâ€™s running.  

- On Windows, this uses a **named pipe** (e.g., `\\.\pipe\mpv-taiga-sync`).  
- You normally donâ€™t need to change this, but advanced users can modify the pipe name in the script if needed for other integrations.

---
## ðŸ—‚ Cache & Thumbnails

- **`matches.json`**: Stores matched folders + AniList metadata (ID, titles, synopsis, cached image filename).  
- **`thumbs/`**: Stores downloaded cover images (named by AniList ID) for instant reloads.  
- To reset matches, delete `matches.json`.  
- To clear cached images, delete the `thumbs/` folder (it will be recreated automatically).

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- If MPV is already playing the same file, the script will not relaunch it.  
- If an anime is not found, make sure its folder name matches at least one AniList or TVDB title/synonym.  
- Non-anime libraries are ignored completely â€” only the ones in `LIBRARY_NAMES` are monitored.
